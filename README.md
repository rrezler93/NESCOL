This repository contains some of the projects, that were created during my time at school.

IMPORTANT: In the repository, only those projects were added for which the implementation was open-booked and required creating a custom program/script to solve a specific problem - thus, each project varied depending on the student. Consequently, many topics covered during the learning process were not included here (like whole SQL Unit) to protect NESCOL's data and avoid sharing answers to closed-book assessments.
